description: Steps to integrate M3 Components into your Solid.js app
---

## Installation

To add M3 Components to your project, run one of the following commands, depending on your package manager:

```bash
npm i @m3-components/solid
yarn add @m3-components/solid
pnpm i @m3-components/solid
bun i @m3-components/solid
deno add npm:@m3-components/solid
```

## Styling

M3 Components uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
You don't need to install Tailwind for the styles to show properly.
After installation, simply import the stylesheet:

```javascript
import "@m3-components/solid/index.css";
```

You can also import it from your global CSS file:

```css
@import "@m3-components/solid/index.css";
```

## API Design

Each component in this library inherits the properties of its root HTML tag, as defined in `solid-js.JSX`.
This allows you to use standard HTML attributes as props with M3 Components, such as `class` or `id`.

To avoid conflicts with native HTML attributes, some component-specific props have been renamed (e.g., `variant` instead of `type`).

> **Note:** Since we use Tailwind CSS for styling,
> any `class` you specify will be merged with component's pre-defined class names.
