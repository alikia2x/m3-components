import { Card, Typography, CardMedia, CardContent, CardActionArea } from "@m3-components/solid";
import ComponentPreview from "@components/ComponentPreview.astro";
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import Mountain from "@assets/Mount_Everest_Unsplash.webp";

Use a card to display content and actions on a single topic.

Cards should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information.
Elements like text and images, should be placed on cards in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## Import

```jsx
import { Card, CardMedia, CardContent, CardActionArea } from "@m3-components/solid";
```

## With Image

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card variant="outlined" class="w-120">
		<CardMedia src={Mountain.src} class="h-50" alt="An image of Mount Everest" />
		<CardContent>
			<Typography.Headline variant="small">Mount Everest</Typography.Headline>
			<Typography.Body>
				Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet). It sits on the border
				between Nepal and Tibet, part of the Himalayas.
			</Typography.Body>
		</CardContent>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```jsx
<Card variant="outlined" class="w-120">
	<CardMedia src={Mountain.src} class="h-50" alt="An image of Mount Everest" />
	<CardContent>
		<Typography.Headline variant="small">Mount Everest</Typography.Headline>
		<Typography.Body>
			Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet). It sits on the border
			between Nepal and Tibet, part of the Himalayas.
		</Typography.Body>

</Card>
```

## Action

You can wrap the content within the card with `CardActionArea` component to allow users to interact with the card.

<ComponentPreview>
	<Card variant="outlined" class="w-120">
		<CardActionArea client:load>
			<CardMedia src={Mountain.src} class="h-50" alt="An image of Mount Everest" />
			<CardContent>
				<Typography.Headline variant="small">Mount Everest</Typography.Headline>
				<Typography.Body>
					Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet). It sits on the
					border between Nepal and Tibet, part of the Himalayas.
				</Typography.Body>
			</CardContent>
		</CardActionArea>
	</Card>
</ComponentPreview>

```jsx
<Card variant="outlined" class="w-120">
	<CardActionArea>
		<CardMedia src={Mountain.src} class="h-50" alt="An image of Mount Everest" />
		<CardContent>
			<Typography.Headline variant="small">Mount Everest</Typography.Headline>
			<Typography.Body>
				Mount Everest is the tallest mountain in the world, at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet). It sits on the border
